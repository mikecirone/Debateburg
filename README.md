Here is a demo of the prototype. Styling is next, but these core features are done or almost done:
 * Debaters can register and login, and logout.
 * Upon logging in, a debater shows up in lobby to other debaters.
 * A debater can challenge another debater to a debate, where he/she chooses the resolution and their side.
   * The other debater can accept or decline the challenge.
 * Upon accepting, both debaters go to a debate chat room:
   * There are 4 debate phases, 2 for each side.
   * While a debater's side is active, he/she can enter debate messages. The other player's message ability is disabled.
 * Users can view past debates.
 
 Some more data.
